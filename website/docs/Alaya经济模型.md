## 1 About Alaya Network

Alaya is designed to become the next-generation of distributed financial infrastructure. With two and half years of development on top of an eight-month technical testing on the Byleyworld test network, we decided to further expand our products towards distributed finance. The original purpose and mission of blockchain technology are to better serve global inclusive finance.

To realize this great vision, Alaya was launched to provide a safe, compliant, and efficient “sandbox” for developers and participants dedicated to various types of DeFi inclusive finance. Alaya is the prelude of Alaya, as well as a bridge connecting distributed and traditional finance.

Communities are encouraged to participate in the governance of testings. Alaya is positioned as a testing ground for innovative technology and distributed finance, and Alaya will focus more on serving financial institutions across the globe and ultimately building up a multi-level business model of finance.

## 2 Alaya’s NativeToken ATP

The native Token ATP on the Alaya network is a technical tool with an initial price of zero, and, is only used as a measurement for this round of operation testing.

​	1.ATP is a test chain tool with an initial price of zero, representing the governance rights and interests of the test chain;

​	2. ATP is for the Alaya network internal use only. It does not have or support other circulation functions.
