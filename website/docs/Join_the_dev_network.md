This article will introduce how to debug local applications by connecting to the `Alaya` development network. 

> Note: The `ChainId` of the Alaya mainnet is 201018; the `ChainId` of the development network is 201030. 

## How to connect to the development network to debug local applications? 

Alaya Development Network has opened the following RPC ports to developers.

```
RPC Addressï¼šhttp://47.241.91.2:6789 and ws://47.241.91.2:6790
```

#### Access to the development network through local programs

On the ubuntu18.04 server, download and install the Alaya binary file with the following command:

```
sudo wget https://download.alaya.network/alaya/platon/0.16.2/alaya -P /usr/bin    
```

Connect to the development network by the following method:

```
alaya attach http://47.241.91.2:6789
```

#### Connect to Alaya development network through SDK

- Use [Java SDK](/alaya-devdocs/en/Java_SDK) to connect to the development network, for example:

```
Web3j platonWeb3j = Web3j.build(new HttpService("http://47.241.91.2:6789"));
```

- Use [JS SDK](/alaya-devdocs/en/JS_SDK) to access the development network, for example:

```
var Web3 = require('web3');
var web3 = new Web3('http://47.241.91.2:6789');
```

- Use [JSON RPC](/alaya-devdocs/en/Json_Rpc) to access the development network, for example: 

```
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"web3_clientVersion","params":[],"id":67}' 47.241.91.2:6789
```

You can also access the network through SDKs in other languages than in the above. 

### Token Receive the development network test token at the faucet

```
 Title: Alaya Development Network Test Token Application
 Name:
 Contact details:
 WeChat ID (or other instant messaging software):
